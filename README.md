**Redesigned Version:**
- Clean, light theme with emerald green accents
- Card-based layouts with better spacing
- Fully responsive design
- Enhanced user feedback and validation
- Progress tracking with visual stepper
- Improved accessibility

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-step booking flow** with 4 distinct steps
- **Skip selection** from real API data with dynamic pricing
- **Placement options** with smart filtering based on skip restrictions
- **Photo upload** for placement verification
- **Date scheduling** with automatic collection date calculation
- **Payment processing** with comprehensive order summary

### Enhanced UX Features
- **Progress stepper** showing current step and completion status
- **Form validation** with real-time error feedback
- **Loading states** for better user feedback
- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile and desktop
- **Smart defaults** and auto-calculations
- **Accessibility improvements** with proper ARIA labels

### Technical Features
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Custom hooks** for form validation and state management
- **Modular components** for maintainability
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Performance optimizations** with proper state management

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
- **Icons:** Lucide React
- **State Management:** React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Form Handling:** Custom validation hooks

## 🎨 Design Approach

### Design System
- **Primary Color:** Emerald green (#10b981) for actions and success states
- **Secondary Colors:** Blue for information, orange for warnings
- **Typography:** Clean, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Spacing:** Consistent 4px grid system
- **Shadows:** Subtle shadows for depth and card separation

### User Experience Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure:** Information revealed step-by-step
2. **Clear Visual Hierarchy:** Important information stands out
3. **Immediate Feedback:** Real-time validation and loading states
4. **Error Prevention:** Smart defaults and validation
5. **Mobile-First:** Responsive design from the ground up

### Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader friendly

## 🔧 Building from Scratch

### Step 1: Project Setup

\`\`\`bash
# Create Next.js project
npx create-next-app@latest skip-hire-booking --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app

# Navigate to project
cd skip-hire-booking

# Install additional dependencies
npm install lucide-react @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-checkbox
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Install shadcn/ui

\`\`\`bash
# Initialize shadcn/ui
npx shadcn@latest init

# Add required components
npx shadcn@latest add button card input label textarea badge
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Create Type Definitions

Create `types/skip.ts` with interfaces for:
- Skip data structure
- Booking state management
- Validation errors

### Step 4: Build Core Components

1. **Progress Stepper** - Visual step indicator
2. **Loading Spinner** - Loading state feedback
3. **Error Message** - User-friendly error display

### Step 5: Create Custom Hooks

Develop `useFormValidation` hook for:
- Email validation
- Required field validation
- Error state management

### Step 6: Build Main Booking Component

Structure the main component with:
- State management for booking flow
- Step rendering functions
- Navigation logic
- Form validation integration

### Step 7: Implement Each Step

1. **Skip Selection:** Grid layout with pricing cards
2. **Placement:** Location options with smart filtering
3. **Scheduling:** Date pickers with auto-calculation
4. **Payment:** Form with order summary

### Step 8: Add Responsive Design

- Mobile-first CSS approach
- Flexible grid systems
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized spacing for small screens

### Step 9: Enhance User Experience

- Loading states for async operations
- Form validation with error messages
- Success feedback and confirmations
- Accessibility improvements

### Step 10: Testing and Optimization

- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile device testing
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility audit
